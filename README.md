# YouAsk
Final project for the Backend Reprograma course in which I created a platform aimed at facilitating interaction between a presenter at an event and their audience through questions asked either with names or anonymously.

#### Access:
With Node.js and MongoDB installed, run npm install and then npm start in the terminal and open localhost:8080 in your web browser.

* To create a room:

Click on **I AM THE HOST**, enter your details and the event name, share this event name with your audience, wait for them to ask questions, and refresh the page to see the questions on the screen.

* To ask questions:

Click on **I AM A GUEST**, enter your details and the event name provided by the host, choose whether to include your name or not, and ask your question. It will appear on the host's screen at the event.

### Stack: ###

`HTML/CSS | Bootstrap | JavaScript`

`NodeJS v10.15.3 | MongoDB | Pacotes listados em package.json.`
